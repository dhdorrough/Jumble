This program can be used to unscramble letters to make words.

It can also be used to find words which match certain specified letters (ala WordWiz) and other games.

Simply fill in the given letters (Available Letters) and press “Scan for Matching Words.” If the matched words are constrained to match letters in certain positions, just enter the required letters in the needed positions.
